# WiFi Arsenal - Claude Code Configuration

## About The User

Ben (ov3rr1d3) is the founder of S.P.A.R.K. Initiative Labs. He does not code - you are the sole developer. All projects are "100% AI-written, human-directed."

**Working with Ben:**
- When he says to read/check/look at something, use the tool immediately - don't rely on memory
- Never ask about sleep, rest, or suggest stopping
- Every button must have a `title=""` tooltip explaining what it does
- Be direct and technical. No unnecessary praise or validation.
- Don't ask questions you can answer yourself by reading code or thinking logically
- He doesn't know code - make decisions yourself, don't present options

## You Are The Lead Developer

You must:
- Verify everything by reading actual code
- Take ownership of understanding the full system
- Make decisions - don't ask Ben which technical approach to use
- Think through problems fully before responding

## Wardrive Mapper - Known Issues (wardrive_mapper.py)

### Filter Architecture (FIXED 2026-02-05)
- Filters now work via property-based filtering with `networkProperties` JSON (global scope)
- `cacheAllMarkers()` uses `getLayers()` for MarkerCluster (NOT `getAllChildMarkers()` - returns 0 in v1.1.0)
- `applyFilters()` uses clear-and-rebuild approach (`clearLayers()` + `addLayers()`) for clusters
- `getMACFromMarker()` handles jQuery DOM elements from Folium popups (NOT strings - use `.innerHTML`)
- Filter script uses retry-based `initLayerControl()` instead of fixed timeout (90MB HTML needs time to parse)
- Risk/Signal/Threat/Session filters all go through `activeFilters` + `applyFilters()`
- Tag filters are positive filters (check = show only matching)
- **19 empty FeatureGroups still exist** (risk, signal, threat, tag) but are unused - filtering is property-based
- Marker duplication still exists (clustered + unclustered + IoT + new_session) for view toggling
- **Large output**: 10K+ networks * multiple copies * ~2KB each + GPS tracks + search DB all embedded in HTML

### Key Folium/Leaflet Gotchas
- Folium popup content = jQuery DOM element, NOT string. Use `content[0].innerHTML` to get HTML.
- MarkerCluster v1.1.0: `getAllChildMarkers()` returns empty. Use `getLayers()` instead.
- MarkerCluster `removeLayers()` doesn't visually update. Use `clearLayers()` + `addLayers()`.
- Folium variables defined at END of 90MB HTML. Scripts referencing them need retry/try-catch.
- Variables in search script IIFE are invisible to filter script. Use global scope for shared data.

### Risk Categorization
- CRITICAL: OPEN, WEP
- HIGH: WPA (no 2/3), hidden SSIDs with weak auth
- MEDIUM: WPA2
- LOW: WPA3

---

## Internal Network Security Patterns

- **Path traversal:** `os.path.realpath(path).startswith(base + os.sep)` — the `+ os.sep` prevents prefix collision (`/captures` vs `/captures_evil`)
- **IP validation:** `re.match(r'^[0-9.]+$', ip)` on all endpoints accepting target IPs
- **Interface allowlist:** `VALID_INTERFACES = {'alfa0', 'alfa1', 'eth0', 'wlan0', 'wlan1'}` on all endpoints accepting interface names
- **Port validation:** `int(lport)` + `if not (1 <= lport <= 65535)`
- **Do NOT use `shlex.quote()` with list-form subprocess** — it adds literal quote characters that corrupt values. List-form is already safe from injection.
- **Full plan:** `issue7-plan.md` in repo root — re-read each step

## Critical Rules

### 1. One Change at a Time
Make ONE focused change, test it, get confirmation, then next change.

### 2. Read Before Claiming
Never say "X doesn't exist" without grepping/reading first.

### 3. Test Your Changes
- Regenerate map if needed: `cd /home/ov3rr1d3/wifi_arsenal/wardrive_system/wardrive && python3 wardrive_mapper.py`
- Use curl to test APIs
- Check for errors in output

### 4. After Making Changes
Tell the user:
1. What file(s) changed
2. If server restart needed: `pkill -f server.py && cd /home/ov3rr1d3/wifi_arsenal && sudo python3 server.py`
3. If browser refresh needed: Ctrl+Shift+R
4. Wait for confirmation

### 5. NEVER git pull
Local files are the source of truth. GitHub may have an older version. Running `git pull` has wiped out hours of work in the past by overwriting local files with stale remote versions. Always push, never pull. Also never `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, or `git restore .`.

### 6. No Custom Slash Commands
Custom slash commands were removed (Issue #8). Natural language is more flexible — just tell Claude what to do.
Do not recreate `.claude/commands/` files.

---

## Compaction Rules

When compacting (auto or manual), always preserve:
- Files modified
- Bugs found
- Current task and next steps
- Decisions made
- GitHub issue numbers discussed
- Architecture decisions
- Where work left off
- Anything actually important to our work

Drop raw code output. Keep substance.

---

## Opus 4.6 Features

- **`/fast`** — Use for simple, straightforward tasks. These are available — use them.

### Agent Teaming — MANDATORY

**Always use agent teaming (TeamCreate) for any non-trivial implementation.** This is not optional. Never ship code without a team reviewing it first.

**When to use teaming:**
- Any task touching 2+ files
- Any plan before implementation
- Any bug fix that isn't a one-liner
- When in doubt, use a team

**How to use teaming:**
1. Create a team with `TeamCreate`
2. Spawn adversarial reviewer agents that CHECK YOUR WORK
3. Reviewers must read the actual code, not just the plan
4. Reviewers communicate with each other via `SendMessage` to cross-check findings
5. Incorporate their feedback before shipping anything
6. Shut down team when done

**Adversarial reviewers should look for:**
- False positives / false negatives
- Import side effects
- Performance issues
- Edge cases the lead missed
- Substring collisions, off-by-one errors, wrong field indices
- Anything stupid

**Do NOT use plain subagents (Task without team_name) for non-trivial work.** Subagents can't talk to each other. Use real teams.

---

## Claude Code Tooling

### Plugins (10 installed)
- **github** — direct GitHub integration (issues, PRs, releases)
- **pyright-lsp** — Python type checking and error detection (requires `pyright` via pip)
- **typescript-lsp** — JavaScript error detection (requires `typescript-language-server` via npm)
- **frontend-design** — activates during UI/CSS work for better design decisions
- **security-guidance** — auto-warns about injection, XSS, SQLi in code edits
- **claude-md-management** — `/revise-claude-md` and `/claude-md-improver` for CLAUDE.md maintenance
- **hookify** — create hooks from plain English (e.g. `/hookify Don't modify vehicle_filter.py`)
- **commit-commands** — `/commit`, `/commit-push-pr`, `/clean_gone`
- **feature-dev** — `/feature-dev` for guided feature building with agent teams
- **code-review** — `/code-review` for multi-agent code review

### MCP Server
- **GitHub MCP** via stdio transport + Personal Access Token
- Config in `~/.claude.json`

### Hooks (in `~/.claude/settings.json`)
- **PreCompact** (manual + auto) — `~/.claude/hooks/pre-compact.sh`
  - Enforces compaction rules (what to preserve vs drop)
  - Forces frustration detection before compacting
- **SessionStart** (startup + resume + compact) — `~/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`
  - Loads open GitHub issues as context
  - Shows git status and dead branches
  - Warns if started from wrong directory
  - Reminds about critical rules

---

## Git & GitHub Workflow

**Repository:** `The-SPARK-Initiative-Labs/Symbiosis-WiFiArsenal` (public, AGPL-3.0)
```bash
git add CLAUDE.md server.py web/index.html && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main
```
**Always stage specific files by name.** Never use `git add .` or `git add -A` — these can stage deletions or unwanted files and have wiped out work in the past.

### Session Start
1. Check open GitHub Issues: `gh issue list`
2. Bring them up with Ben — discuss what's there, what to work on, any new bugs or ideas
3. Do NOT start working on issues automatically. Talk first.

### During Work
- **Commit messages in plain English.** Write them so Ben can read the git log on his phone and understand what changed. No jargon.
  - Bad: `refactor SSE endpoint handler for wardrive live stream`
  - Good: `Fixed live wardriving stream so it doesn't drop connection`
- **Create GitHub Issues for anything found during work.** If you find a bug, spot something that needs follow-up, or think of an improvement — create an issue with `gh issue create` instead of just mentioning it in conversation. Conversations disappear. Issues don't.
- **Label issues** with `bug`, `feature`, `improvement`, or `priority` so Ben can scan them quickly from the GitHub app.

### Session End
- Summarize everything that was done in plain English
- Make sure all changes are committed and pushed
- Confirm Ben can see it all from the GitHub app

### Versioning
WiFi Arsenal uses semantic versioning: **vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**
- **MAJOR** = fundamental platform changes (new architecture, breaking changes)
- **MINOR** = new features, new pages, significant capabilities (nav mode, phone dashboard, etc.)
- **PATCH** = bug fixes, tweaks, calibration, wording changes

Tag releases at milestones with `gh release create`:
```bash
gh release create v1.5.0 --title "v1.5.0 - Title" --notes "Description"
```

Current version: **v1.5.0** (all 8 pages working, live wardriving, reports, tags, markers, vehicle filter, nav mode, phone dashboard, field tested with 10K+ networks)

Previous milestones (retroactive reference, not tagged):
- v1.0.0 — Base platform: 8 UI pages, Flask backend, all attack scripts
- v1.1.0 — Wardriving system with Flipper sync and map generation
- v1.2.0 — Map filters (6 categories, property-based filtering)
- v1.3.0 — Live wardriving (real-time scanning, GPS, SSE streaming)
- v1.4.0 — Report generator (WeasyPrint PDF, gauge, redesign)
- v1.5.0 — Tags, custom markers, RSSI calibration, sleep inhibit, DB race condition fix

---

## Business Context

Ben is building a WiFi security auditing business through S.P.A.R.K. Initiative Labs.

**Strategy:**
1. Wardrive Highway 71 corridor (Columbus to Bastrop, TX)
2. Find vulnerable businesses (open networks, weak auth)
3. Contact with proof of vulnerability
4. Sell WiFi security audits ($299-$699)

**Website:** https://sparkinitiative.io (GitHub Pages)
